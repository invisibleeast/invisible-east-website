    <p>
        This is a map of all the place names identified by the Invisible East Team in the texts of the Invisible East Digital Corpus. If you click on a pin, you can see all the texts in our corpus which mention this toponym. Please bear in mind that the exact geographical location of origin is not always possible to establish. It is, therefore, only an approximation.
