    <p>
        The map below is a visualisation tool that geographically locates the places from which the documents in our corpus came. You can learn more about each subset by clicking on the place markers. The subsets are categorised by language and location; scroll down on the left side to see documents in multiple languages from given sites. You can also "enable map scroll" to zoom in all the way down to street level. This map was created by the Invisible East team, with cartographer Michael Athanson, and references to it should credit the Invisible East programme.
