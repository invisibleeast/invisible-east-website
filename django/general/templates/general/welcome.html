    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to Invisible East. We are a research programme at the University of Oxfordâ€™s Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies that studies the 8th-13th century Islamicate world in Iran, Afghanistan and Central Asia. We transcribe, translate and analyse some of the oldest texts written in New Persian, Judeo-Persian, Arabic, Bactrian, Sogdian, Khotanese and Middle Persian, in order to shed new light on political, financial and legal infrastructures, and religious diversity of the region.
    </p>
    <p>
        The programme is financed until 2025 with a core staff of seven researchers funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) and European Research Council (ERC) respectively in the Go.Local and PersDoc projects, both of which are led by Senior Research Fellow Arezou Azad.
